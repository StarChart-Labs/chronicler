# Code Release Process

* Update the version number to remove the "-SNAPSHOT" designation. All version numbers should be a fully-qualified semantic version of form `<major>.<minor>.<micro>`
* Change the header "Unreleased" in CHANGE_LOG.md to the target release number, and create a new "Unreleased" header above it
* Run a full build via `./gradlew clean build`
  * If there are any errors, stash the changes to the version number and changelog until the issue can be corrected and merged to master as a separate commit/issue
* Perform a test deployment to the "dev" site via `serverless deploy` (Ensure you first perform the one-time setup below if this is your first deployment)
  * Deployment will load onto chronicler-dev.starchartlabs.org. Verify HTML updated, and install button correctly links to the App page
* Commit the version number and CHANGE_LOG updates
* Tag the git repository with the fully-qualified semantic version number
* Deploy to the production site via `serverless deploy --stage production`
  * Verify the HTML updated, and the install button leads to the App page
  * Ensure App is public! Test install button in a private browser window to ensure non-starchart individuals may access the app
* Change version number to `<released version> + 1 micro` + `-SNAPSHOT`
* Commit to git
* Push changes and tag to GitHub
* Create a release on GitHub including all binary and source jars

# Deployment

Deployment of Chronicler is done in the context of a "stage". A "stage" is something like "dev", "test", or "production" - a distinct environment where a full copy of the application will be independently deployed and run.

# One Time Setup

To deploy Chronicler for a given stage, the following manual setup is required once:

 - First, it is necessary to install `serverless` and then the plug-ins needed for major-tom
    - [Install serverless](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)
        - This includes configuring serverless keys for AWS
    - Install the below plugins via [serverless plugin install](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/plugin-install/)
 - Create a GitHub App configuration for the stage
 	- Using the description in [the GitHub App documentation](./GITHUB_APP_SETTINGS.md), setup a GitHub App, replacing the title and URLs to match the stage being setup
 - Configure a Webhook Secret and download the secret key
 	- These will be added to AWS in the next step, retain them until that time
 - On [AWS System Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager), login with an admin StarChart-Labs account and create the following values in Parameter Store:
 	- /${stage}/chronicler/github/app/id
 		- The GitHub App ID (available in the General section of the App's information, in "About")
 	- /${stage}/chronicler/github/app/key
 		- The contents of the secret key downloaded from the App, WITHOUT the leading BEGIN/END key headers and footers (Parameter store doesn't seem to deal with newlines, this and code within the App that re-adds them is a workaround)
 	- /${stage}/chronicler/github/webhook-secret
 		- The webhook secret configured on the GitHub App
 - At this point, local copies of the secret and key may be discarded - they can be regenerated and configured later if necessary
 - The last one-time step will be to go to [AWS API Gateway Custom Domain Names]
   - Create the appropriate domain name
   - Find the "Target Domain Name" entry, and add a DNS record on Google Domains for the target URL
